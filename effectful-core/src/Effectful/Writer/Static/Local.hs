-- | Support for access to a write only value of a particular type.
--
-- The value is thread local. If you want it to be shared between threads, use
-- "Effectful.Writer.Static.Shared".
--
-- /Warning:/ 'Writer'\'s state will be accumulated via __left-associated__ uses
-- of '<>', which makes it unsuitable for use with types for which such pattern
-- is inefficient. __This applies, in particular, to the standard list type__,
-- which makes the 'Writer' effect pretty niche.
--
-- __If you just want to accumulate values, use "Effectful.Output.Static.Array.Local".__
--
-- /Note:/ while the 'Control.Monad.Trans.Writer.Strict.Writer' from the
-- @transformers@ package includes additional operations
-- 'Control.Monad.Trans.Writer.Strict.pass' and
-- 'Control.Monad.Trans.Writer.Strict.censor', they don't cooperate with runtime
-- exceptions very well, so they're deliberately omitted here.
